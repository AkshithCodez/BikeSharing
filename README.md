🚴‍♀️ End-to-End Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
Predicting bike rentals made simple, accurate, and interactive!
This project builds a complete machine learning pipeline to forecast the hourly demand for the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington D.C. From handling raw data all the way to deploying a real-time prediction app, this project showcases a full end-to-end ML workflow.

With advanced feature engineering, a competitive model selection process, and a user-friendly interface, the final solution achieves an impressive R² score of 0.96 🎯

🌟 Key Highlights
Modular Codebase: Clean, reusable, and production-ready project architecture.

Feature Engineering Superpowers:

Cyclical time features with sine/cosine transformations (hour, month).

Interaction features (e.g., weather × rush hour).

Comfort Index: Combining temperature and humidity into a single "feels-like" metric.

Model Arena: Trains multiple models (linear regression to gradient boosting) and selects the champion automatically.

Seamless Preprocessing: Scikit-learn pipelines for scaling, encoding, and feature handling.

Interactive App: A Streamlit dashboard where anyone can input conditions and instantly predict demand.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries:

Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

Web: Streamlit

Utilities: dill (object serialization)

🤖 Modeling Approach
We put our models in the ring and let them compete until the best one earns the crown. The lineup:

Linear Models: Linear, Lasso, Ridge

Trees & Ensembles: Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting

Boosting Giants: XGBoost, LightGBM (usually the winner!)

The final model saved for deployment consistently reaches R² = 0.96, meaning it captures nearly all the variability in bike rental demand 🚀

⚡ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/BikeSharing.git
cd BikeSharing
2. Create a Virtual Environment
bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
3. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 How to Run
Step 1: Train the Model
This will handle ingestion, transformation, training, and save the best model.

bash
python -m src.pipeline.train_pipeline
You’ll see logs in the console, along with the final R² score of the best model.

Step 2: Launch the Web App
Start the interactive dashboard with:

bash
streamlit run app.py
The app runs locally at http://localhost:8501 – simply enter conditions (like weather and time) and get instant demand predictions!

📊 Results
✅ Final Trained Model: LightGBM / XGBoost (depending on competition)
✅ Performance: R² Score = 0.96
✅ Deployment: Real-time interactive web application

The model excels at predicting bike demand during weekdays, commutes, and even under extreme weather conditions, making it a valuable tool for urban mobility planning.
